# html-tests

Pages for testing various HTML features, test cases for browser bugs, etc., for later reference.

Not extensive, just covers topics as they arise in my work.

To use with pow webserver: 
- Make a symlink in your ~/.pow directory, pointing to /public.
- Browse the local version via http://html-tests.dev
